### Worker pools and outgoing connections
            
Allocate new worker pool with a count of workers that can handle a second of maximum incoming requests limit-i
Maximum size of pool can be calculated as urls-count / limit-c * limit-i * limit-c = 20 / 4 * 100 * 4 = 2000.
It's number of all workers that should be allocated to cover the worst case scenario for the long run: 100 incoming requests with 20 urls and
each url takes little less a second for each second.

This is pretty artificial scenario, so elastic pool grow chosen to avoid useless resource consumptions.
