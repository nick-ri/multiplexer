# Multiplexer

It's a simple app that serve limited count of clients, it returns a result of collecting data for multiple remote resources.

### Requirements
- golang 1.14.4

### Project structure

- **api** - contains handlers, middleware and error helpers.
- **cmd** - holds commands: main application files `multiplexer` and `limiter` - cli util to check rate-limiter works.
- **collector** - contain minimalistic elastic worker pool implementation that collect data from the net.
- **limit** - simplified version of slided window counter rate-limiter.
- **transport** - wrapper code that provides functionality of using middleware and simplify routers declaration.


### Worker pools and outgoing connections
            
Allocate new worker pool with a count of workers that can handle a second of maximum incoming requests limit-i
Maximum size of pool can be calculated as `max-urls-count / limit-outgoing-connections * limit-incomming-comnnections * limit-outgoing-connections` = `20 / 4 * 100 * 4 = 2000`.
It's number of all workers that should be allocated to cover the worst case scenario for the long run: 100 incoming requests for each second with 20 urls and
each url takes little less a second.

```
=========================== SECONDS =================================>
1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
      1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
      400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
            1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
            400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
                  1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
                  400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
                        1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
                        400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
                         ↑    1(4)  2(4)  3(4)  4(4)  5(4)
                 max preasure 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - releasing workers
.......................................................................
```

This is pretty artificial scenario, so elastic grow for worker pool chosen to avoid useless resource consumptions.


### Rate limiting

That project contains the minimalistic version of [slided window counter](https://medium.com/figma-design/an-alternative-approach-to-rate-limiting-f8a06cf7c94c) rate-limiter which provides more or less accurate results.

Each new request it's trying to renew existed windows previous and current if sliding window collides with the current window. 
The final formula to approx. count is: `count_in_prev_window * (window_size-window_offset)/window_size + count_in_curr_window` where:
- `count_in_prev_window`: previous window number of requests.
- `window_size`: is how long all windows in time terms.
- `window_offset`: calculated difference between the current window and sliding window(in which all checks happening).
- `count_in_curr_window`: current window count number of requests.

#### To check how it's works 

Run multiplexer:
```shell script
$ go run ./cmd/multiplexer
```

Collect the data:

```shell script
$ curl -X POST -d '["https://google.com", "https://youtube.com", "https://facebook.com", "https://wikipedia.org", "https://www.amazon.com", "https://live.com", "https://zoom.us"]' http://localhost:8080/collect
```

#### Test rate limiting 

Run special cli command `$ go run ./cmd/limiter -limit 30`.
After that run load testing [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) tool: `$ echo "GET http://localhost:8080/limit" | vegeta attack -rate=50 -duration=15s | vegeta report`

Check the results:

```shell script
